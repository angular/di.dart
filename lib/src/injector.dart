   * Thus, if a descendant D of the child requests an instance for K, the child
   * will mask any binding for K made by a proper ancestor injector, provided
   * that P's visbility reveals the child's binding to D.
   * For example, if the child has no proper descendant and P's visibility
   * deems that the child is visible to the child itself, then the first
   * request for the child to get an instance for K will trigger the creation of
   * a new instance.
